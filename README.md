# FortressDefenseWithGUI

This is a Battleship style game where the player clicks on the game board to shoot at chosen tiles in hopes of destroying all the enemy tanks
before their fortress is destroyed.

The game was created as part of a class assignment in groups of pairs. We were given bare bones requirements to fulfill such as a minimum 
number of classes to use. Much of the design was left up to us.
